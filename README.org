This package has been forked from the great work by [[https://github.com/jinnovation/magit-arcanist][Jonathan Jin]].

This package provides integration for [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] to natively interact with [[https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist/][Arcanist]],
the CLI for [[https://phacility.com/][Phabricator]].

* Dependencies
