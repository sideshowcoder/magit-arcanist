This package has been forked from the great work by [[https://github.com/jinnovation/magit-arcanist][Jonathan Jin]].

This package provides integration for [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] to natively interact with [[https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/arcanist/][Arcanist]],
the CLI for [[https://phacility.com/][Phabricator]].

* Dependencies

- [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]]

* Usage Instructions

All initialization logic is taken care of by the =magit-arcanist-enable=
function. Some configuration variables, e.g. =magit-arcanist-key=, need to be
set prior to the enable function's invocation.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'magit
    (require 'magit-arcanist)

    (setq magit-arcanist-key (kbd "@")) ;; or whatever strikes your fancy

    (magit-arcanist-enable))
#+end_src

* Known Issues & Solutions

The original =magit-process-yes-or-no-prompt-regexp= does not capture arc input
prompts see [[https://github.com/magit/magit/commit/af6d542d09ddbeb9a2040ad585978c775f5277e4][related magit commit]], customizing to

#+begin_src
    [[(]\([Yy]\(?:es\)?\)[/|]\([Nn]o?\)\(?:/\[fingerprint\]\)?[])] ?[?:]? ?$
 #+end_src

fixes this, and it should be addressed in the most recent magit release.
